# Zomato Data Analysis using Python

## Project Overview

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a Zomato restaurant dataset using Python.
The goal is to analyze customer ordering behavior, restaurant types, ratings, and ordering patterns using data visualization techniques.

The analysis helps understand trends such as:

* Which restaurant types customers prefer
* How ratings are distributed
* Differences between **online and offline orders**
* Customer spending patterns

The project demonstrates **data cleaning, data transformation, and visualization** using Python libraries.

According to the project description, the dataset represents restaurants with attributes such as restaurant name, online order availability, ratings, votes, cost for two people, and restaurant type.

# Dataset

The dataset contains information about restaurants including:

* **name** – Restaurant name
* **online_order** – Whether online ordering is available
* **book_table** – Table booking availability
* **rate** – Restaurant rating
* **votes** – Number of votes received
* **approx_cost(for two people)** – Average cost for two people
* **listed_in(type)** – Restaurant category (Dining, Cafes, Buffet, etc.)

# Project Workflow

### 1. Import Libraries

Libraries used in the project:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn

### 2. Data Loading

The dataset is loaded using pandas.

```python
dataframe = pd.read_csv("Zomato data.csv")
```

### 3. Data Cleaning

* Converted rating column values to numeric format
* Removed unnecessary characters
* Checked for missing values

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA is performed to understand relationships between different variables.

# Key Business Questions

The analysis answers the following questions:

1. What type of restaurant do most customers order from?
2. How many votes has each restaurant type received?
3. What ratings do most restaurants have?
4. What is the average spending of couples per order?
5. Which restaurant types receive more offline orders?

These questions are part of the problem statement provided in the project.

# Visualizations Used

The project includes multiple visualizations:

* Count plots
* Histograms
* Pie Charts

These visualizations help interpret customer behavior and restaurant performance.

# Key Insights


* **Dining restaurants are the most common type of restaurants** in the dataset, indicating that customers frequently prefer dining-style establishments.

* **Dining restaurants also receive the highest number of votes**, suggesting they are the most popular among customers.

* **Most restaurant ratings fall between 3.5 and 4.0**, which indicates that the majority of restaurants have moderately good ratings.

* **Restaurants offering online ordering tend to have a higher average cost (~₹510 for two people)** compared to restaurants without online ordering (~₹359).

* **Online orders generally receive higher ratings compared to offline orders**, indicating better customer satisfaction for online ordering services.

* **Dining restaurants receive more offline orders, while cafes receive relatively more online orders**, suggesting different customer behavior depending on restaurant type.


These insights are derived from the visual analysis performed in the notebook.
